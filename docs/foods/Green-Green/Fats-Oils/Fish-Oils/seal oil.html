    <i>We only need about one gram each of omega-6 and omega-3 oils. We need to strip out the omega-6 oils to the point where we are only consuming a couple of grams a day at most, and we need to make sure we get at least one gram a day of omega-3 oils. Eating oily fish every day will help you boost your intake of omega-3.</i>

    <i>Traditionally, the Japanese are Buddhists and, as such, they did not eat animals at all. However, they did eat fish, often raw. By Western standards, it was a high consumption, around 90 g (3.15 oz) per person per day (four times as much as the average American). From this, they got a high consumption of omega-3 fish oil, notably the essential fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA).</i>

    <i>Eat no more than 10% of calories as fat/oil. Focus on consumption of bioavailable omega-3 fatty acids, reduce consumption of bioavailable omega-6 fatty acids, and avoid foods with bioavailable "bad" fatty acids.</i>

    <i>Many studies and trials show that when patients consume a normalized intake of essential fatty acids, their schizophrenia is improved. That is, consumption of omega-3 oils is increased and omega-6 oils are sharply reduced to bring them into balance. One of the fish oils, EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid), seems to play a crucial role.</i>

<p>
    <i>Studies on Eskimos demonstrate that a high consumption of omega-3 fatty acids (in their case, mainly from fish oils) improve insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. These confirm other studies suggesting that insulin sensitivity is improved when omega-3 intake is increased. Follow the Savanna Model and make sure you have the omega-6 to omega-3 intakes in balance.</i>
