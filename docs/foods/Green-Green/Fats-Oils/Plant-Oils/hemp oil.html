    <i>We only need about one gram each of omega-6 and omega-3 oils. We need to strip out the omega-6 oils to the point where we are only consuming a couple of grams a day at most, and we need to make sure we get at least one gram a day of omega-3 oils. Eating oily fish every day will help you boost your intake of omega-3.</i>

    <i>Those who have good levels of the omega-3 oils, whether fish oils or alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), have a lower risk</i> of breast cancer.

</p>

<p>
    <i>Many studies and trials show that when patients consume a normalized intake of essential fatty acids, their schizophrenia is improved. That is, consumption of omega-3 oils is increased and omega-6 oils are sharply reduced to bring them into balance. One of the fish oils, EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid), seems to play a crucial role.</i>

</p>

<p>
    <i>Studies on Eskimos demonstrate that a high consumption of omega-3 fatty acids (in their case, mainly from fish oils) improve insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. These confirm other studies suggesting that insulin sensitivity is improved when omega-3 intake is increased. Follow the Savanna Model and make sure you have the omega-6 to omega-3 intakes in balance.</i>

        <i>... consume oils sparingly. We should focus on omega-3 oils. A prime example is canola (rapeseed) oil, which is readily available in supermarkets. However, we recommend going for cold-pressed, organic canola oil, if possible. Flaxseed oil has the highest concentrations of omega-3s and is preferred if you can afford it. The oil is fragile and needs to be kept in the refrigerator and consumed within a few weeks. Other options are hempseed oil and walnut oil (make sure it is not made from roasted walnuts).</i>

        <i>Be frugal with fats and oils, even the "Green" classes. Never cook at high temperatures. Only bake or sauté at low temperatures— less than 320°F (160°C), although this may be a little higher for baking. Only use olive oil or canola (rapeseed) oil. Hot or cold, replace "Red" classes of fats and oils with "Green" classes such as olive oil, canola (rapeseed, colza) oil, hempseed oil, and flax oils ...</i>
