    <i>We only need about one gram each of omega-6 and omega-3 oils. We need to strip out the omega-6 oils to the point where we are only consuming a couple of grams a day at most, and we need to make sure we get at least one gram a day of omega-3 oils. Eating oily fish every day will help you boost your intake of omega-3.</i>

<p>
    <i>Many studies and trials show that when patients consume a normalized intake of essential fatty acids, their schizophrenia is improved. That is, consumption of omega-3 oils is increased and omega-6 oils are sharply reduced to bring them into balance. One of the fish oils, EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid), seems to play a crucial role.</i>

<p>
    <i>Studies on Eskimos demonstrate that a high consumption of omega-3 fatty acids (in their case, mainly from fish oils) improve insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. These confirm other studies suggesting that insulin sensitivity is improved when omega-3 intake is increased. Follow the Savanna Model and make sure you have the omega-6 to omega-3 intakes in balance.</i>

        <i>... consume oils sparingly. We should focus on omega-3 oils. A prime example is canola (rapeseed) oil, which is readily available in supermarkets. However, we recommend going for cold-pressed, organic canola oil, if possible. Flaxseed oil has the highest concentrations of omega-3s and is preferred if you can afford it. The oil is fragile and needs to be kept in the refrigerator and consumed within a few weeks. Other options are hempseed oil and walnut oil (make sure it is not made from roasted walnuts).</i>

        <i>All these omega-3 oils should only be used cold—in a salad dressing, for example. Omega-3 oils do not resist heat very well and the oil oxidizes and becomes toxic. If you need to heat the oil for cooking, then a monounsaturated (and thus inert) oil is best. Canola oil can fit the bill since its omega-3 content will withstand modest temperatures up to 340°F. We advise that cooking should never exceed this temperature anyway, but if it does, then olive oil is safest to use.</i>

        <i>Be frugal with fats and oils, even the "Green" classes. Never cook at high temperatures. Only bake or sauté at low temperatures— less than 320°F (160°C), although this may be a little higher for baking. Only use olive oil or canola (rapeseed) oil. Hot or cold, replace "Red" classes of fats and oils with "Green" classes such as olive oil, canola (rapeseed, colza) oil, hempseed oil, and flax oils ...</i>

        <i>Try this quick (five-minute) method of cooking vegetables. Put a quarter-inch of water into a saucepan with a sliced clove of garlic and a bay leaf (or a pinch of oregano). Add a tablespoon of canola oil. The boiling water forms an emulsion with the oil. Add vegetables (fresh or frozen). Heat moderately with the cover on, but stir frequently, too. The vegetables cook fast, partly by boiling and partly by steaming. At the end, when the vegetables are close to done, heat vigorously and stir continuously until all the water has gone. They will be a beautiful golden brown when the water has evaporated. Always use plenty of herbs. As many vegetables soak up oil, this method greatly reduces the quantity of oil absorbed.</i>

        <i>With regard to animal matter, many methods of conservation are acceptable. Canned oily fish (such as sardines) are, in nutritional terms, just as good as fresh. Just choose the versions that are preserved in olive oil, canola oil, or unsalted water. Smoked salmon or kipper are good, although watch out for high salt content.</i>

        For the Japanese, <i>The largest percentage of their fat came from rapeseed (canola) oil. East Asians have cultivated rapeseed for millennia, and the Japanese have used rapeseed oil in frugal amounts for at least 2,000 years. To a lesser extent, they used soybean oil. Consumption of saturated fats, hydrogenated fats, and trans fatty acids was almost zero.</i>

        <i>It is difficult to imagine, but just 100 years ago corn oil, peanut oil, sunflower oil, rapeseed oil (Canola oil), safflower oil, cottonseed oil, and other "vegetable" oils were virtually unknown to the ordinary consumer. They existed, of course, but only as an unwanted by-product of agricultural processes.</i>

        <i>Omega-3 EFAs are found in plants and animal matter. In plants, the most common form is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), found particularly in walnuts, flaxseed, hempseed, and rapeseed (canola oil). In animals, omega-3 oils are particularly found in "oily" fish, such as sardines, salmon, trout, and tuna.</i>
