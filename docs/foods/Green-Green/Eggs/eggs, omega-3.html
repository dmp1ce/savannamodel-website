        <i>The manufacturer, Quorn, makes it available either in its raw state as a kind of ground meat look-alike or made up into veggie burgers, frankfurters, and soon. Mycoprotein is by far the best meat substitute when compared to soy protein or wheat gluten protein (seitan). Mycoprotein has a medium protein content, on a par with eggs (about 12 g protein per 100 g).</i>

        <i>Our Pleistocene forebears consumed all kinds of eggs: Ostrich, bustard, duck, and anything else they could find. Hen's eggs come close, with a proviso— seek out eggs that are rich in omega-3 oils, and it is preferable if they are also free-range and organic. Duck, turkey, quail, and goose eggs are good, too. Industrially produced eggs are a poor substitute and should not be consumed on a regular basis.</i>

        <i>Try to rid yourself of notions about which foods are to be eaten at which meals: For example, eggs are often thought of as being purely a breakfast food. In fact, you can eat them at any meal. The same goes for just about every dish: They can be eaten at any time of day.</i>

        <i>Omega-3-rich, free-range eggs any style are fine to start the day. Make a hearty vegetable-filled omelet or grill some tomatoes and mushrooms to go with the eggs. Don't forget that plant food should form the major part of the meal, and no backsliding— definitely no bread.</i>

        <i>Get in the habit of thinking that a salad is often in two parts: The salad vegetables, comprised uniquely of foods from Food Group 3 (Non-starchy Vegetables), and some additions of protein-rich foods from Food Group 6 (Meat, Poultry, Eggs, and Fish). You can add tuna or chicken breast, for example, to the salad or eat as a side dish. Use a simple homemade vinaigrette of mustard, olive oil, lemon juice, and vinegar.</i>

        <i>Dinner  involves  the  same  decision-making  process  as  at lunch  time.  This  time you decide to do some cooking. Maybe 12 oz per person of stir-fried vegetables accompanied by two eggs,  any style.  Or a  grilled  trout with a  head of steamed broccoli.  It's as easy as that.</i>

        <i>In our African Pleistocene past, our ancestors did indeed have fire, but they had no way to boil water. They generally ate plant food raw, although they often roasted tubers and sometimes roasted nuts and other materials. Animal matter, according to convenience, type, and body part, was eaten raw or roasted. Eggs were also eaten raw.</i>

        <i>Meat, poultry, eggs, and fish (Food Group 6) can be cooked using the most appropriate method: Microwaving, steaming, grilling, baking, or sauteing. Avoid deep-frying. If using oil, just use a light coating of olive oil.</i>

        <i>Of course, many people bring up their children successfully as vegetarians. However, staying with the Savanna Model, fish and fowl are fine. Free-range, omega-3-rich eggs are always good in any quantity. Just remember, you don't have to give your child anything that, as a Bond Effect practitioner, you would not eat yourself.</i>

        <i>Eskimos hunted fish, seal, whale, walrus, musk ox, caribou, polar bears, wolves, birds, rabbits, ducks, and geese. They ate every part of the animal—brains, blood, intestines, and even the feces. On occasion, the women would gather eggs, crabs, mollusks, and shellfish.</i>

        <i>The women also collect eggs of all kinds and capture small animals such as locusts, caterpillars, grubs, toads, tortoises, and snakes. Ostrich eggs are particularly valued. The contents supply a good portion of food, the shells make containers for water, and bits of shell are carved into beads.</i>

        <i>Total animal matter consumption (that is, game animals plus eggs and all the gathered and fished animals) is no more than around 8 ounces (225 g) per person per day. Plant food is about 2 pounds (900 g) per day. This weight of food is rather less than even the San would like to be eating</i>

        <i>Several studies have examined the effort compared to the benefit for various feeding patterns. Not surprisingly, they find that, overall, it requires the least effort to collect foodstuffs that stay still or only move very slowly. Therefore, plants of all kinds, eggs, and slow-moving animals provide the vast bulk of the diet. In addition, foods that require little or no processing are given top priority. As we saw, the Aboriginal only ate grass seed as a last resort; it was just too time-consuming and tedious.</i>

        <i>Eggs formed a regular part of our ancestors' diet whenever they could find them. Of course, they were not restricted in the species of bird— anything from guinea fowl eggs to ostrich eggs would do just fine. Being in the tropics, the seasons did not vary much throughout the year, so there was usually the egg of some bird or another available most of the time for the San.</i>

        <i>The first farmers had to go looking for wild eggs. The Fertile Crescent is outside the tropics (it is about the same latitude as Washington, D.C.) and mostly eggs only came along in spring. It was not until chickens were domesticated that eggs were "farmed": wherever the chicken arrived, the hen's egg arrived too.</i>

    <p>
        <i>In due course, as duck, goose, and turkey were domesticated, these creatures were bred for their eggs as well. Today, with the enormous advantage of price and the massive volume of battery-hen production, it is the hen's egg that totally dominates the food supply.</i>
 ~<a href="../../../about.html">Deadly Harvest</a> p.61

    <p>
        <i>The gathering of wild eggs today is greatly restricted by government regulation in most developed countries. However, the eggs of many species are available in small quantities as a by-product of the management of game birds. In this way, eggs from quail, pigeons, gulls, lapwings, plovers, pheasants, and ostriches are available to culinary enthusiasts.</i>

        <i>Protein-rich plant foods fall into two broad classes, nuts and legumes. Their protein content is comparable to that of lean beef steak—20% to 25% and sometimes more. In contrast, an egg is only around 13% protein.</i>

        <i>Humans evolved in an area, the African Rift Valley, that was endowed with lakes and streams. Humans of that time freely consumed shellfish, fish, wading birds, and ducks and their eggs. Leigh Broadhurst calculates that the quantities consumed did not have to be large— just 6% to 12% of calories.</i>

        <i>What are acid-forming foods? Not foods that taste acidic, but rather the ones that after digestion and metabolism have the effect of acidifying the body. They are foods that contain sulfur, phosphorus, and chlorine— found chiefly in proteins like meat, fish, eggs, and cheese. For example, bland roast chicken is one of the most acidifying foods around. Starches like bread, flour, pasta, and cereals are also acid forming.</i>

        <i>Dr. Artemis Simopoulos of the Center for Genetics, Nutrition, and Health, in Washington, D.C., is one of the foremost advocates of the need to incorporate omega-3 oils in the human diet. He observes that "on the Ampelistra farm in Greece, purslane is plentiful and grows wild; the chickens make a feast of it, along with insects and lots of fresh green grass, supplemented with fresh and dried figs, barley flour, and small amounts of corn. . . . As we expected, the eggs contained substantial amounts of omega-3 fatty acids."38 The Greek egg had an omega-6 to omega-3 ratio of 1.3 to 1, whereas a supermarket egg has a ratio of almost 20 to 1. The point is that many animal products have become unhealthy because the feed given to the animal bears no resemblance to the natural feeding pattern of the creature. As a result, the flesh and eggs are devoid of omega-3 oils.</i>

    </p>
    
    <p>
        <i>The food industry should correct this imbalance. One of the secrets to the Greek free-range egg is the omega-3-rich purslane that the chickens were eating. Now some egg farmers are producing omega-3 rich eggs by feeding the chicken on flaxseed, which is itself rich in omega-3s.</i>

        <i>Animal matter can provide the same micronutrients as plants, such as calcium and vitamin A, but there is one essential micronutrient that has to be obtained from animal matter—vitamin B12. It is only needed in tiny amounts and it is easily obtained from eggs, fish, poultry, and meat. However, without it, we sicken and die, unlike the vegan gorilla who can manage without it.</i>

        <i>Contrary to the prevalent myth, consuming high-cholesterol foods like eggs has little effect on cholesterol levels, if the diet conforms to the Savanna Model. As Paleolithic expert Boyd Eaton observes, the San Bushmen consumed just as much cholesterol as the average American, yet they maintained very low levels of cholesterol in the blood.</i>
