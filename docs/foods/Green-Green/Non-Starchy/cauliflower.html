<p>Cauliflower is a <i>Green-Green</i> food and safe to eat as a regular part of your diet.</p>

<p>
<i>Eat at least 2 3/4 lbs of mixed salad and vegetables per day, consisting of "Green-Green” and “Green” foods. Of these, at least 3/4 lb should be mixed salad. Also include at least 5 cups of “Green-Green” leafy vegetables or 2 1/2 cups of other vegetables per week.</i> ~<a href="../../../about.html">Paleo in a Nutshell</a> p.102

        <i>Through  the  afternoon, you  may begin to  feel  hungry.  Keep  ready prepared  in your  fridge  some  raw  broccoli,  cauliflower,  and  baby  carrots,  and  also  have some containers of preservative-free dips, such as guacamole.</i>

        <i>With regard to plant food, it is always best to eat it as soon as possible after harvesting and to eat it raw. That is why we put the emphasis on the consumption  of  salads  and  for  them  to  be  as  fresh  as  possible.  Be  imaginative—many vegetables  can  form  part  of  a  mixed  salad,  including  chopped  broccoli,  cauliflower, cabbage, zucchini, and leeks.</i>
