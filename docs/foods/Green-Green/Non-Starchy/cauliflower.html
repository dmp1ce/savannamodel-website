        <i>Through  the  afternoon, you  may begin to  feel  hungry.  Keep  ready prepared  in your  fridge  some  raw  broccoli,  cauliflower,  and  baby  carrots,  and  also  have some containers of preservative-free dips, such as guacamole.</i>

        <i>With regard to plant food, it is always best to eat it as soon as possible after harvesting and to eat it raw. That is why we put the emphasis on the consumption  of  salads  and  for  them  to  be  as  fresh  as  possible.  Be  imaginative—many vegetables  can  form  part  of  a  mixed  salad,  including  chopped  broccoli,  cauliflower, cabbage, zucchini, and leeks.</i>

        <i>"Fresh is best" is a familiar slogan and it is good for us, too. However, that is not always possible, so how do we prioritize? Broadly speaking, the "least bad" alternative to fresh plant food is frozen. Frozen plant foods, such as cauliflower, spinach, and chopped onion, have been quickly prepared in the field, and then blanched and frozen nearby. Blanching is designed to destroy certain enzymes that cause discoloration, softening, and bruising. It is likely that these are background micronutrients that are useful to the human body and become lost in the blanching process. So, here we make a compromise: In the absence of an alternative, freezing is the least of all evils.</i>

        <i>The vegetables from above ground cover a huge range of plant parts: stems, such as asparagus from the Mediterranean and kohlrabi from Europe; buds, such as Brussels sprouts from Belgium; leafstalks, such as celery from the Mediterranean and rhubarb from Asia; leaves, such as Europe's cabbage, lettuce, and spinach; immature flowers, such as cauliflower from Europe, broccoli from Turkey, and artichoke from the western Mediterranean; immature fruits, such as eggplant from southern Asia and cucumber from northern India; mature "vegetable-fruits," such as tomato from Peru, avocado from Central America, and bell pepper from the Andes; edible bean pods, such as runner beans from tropical America; and edible fungi (mushrooms) from just about everywhere. Of course, today, these plants are grown all over the world, wherever farmers can produce them economically</i>
