<p>Brussels sprouts is a <i>Green-Green</i> food and safe to eat as a regular part of your diet.</p>

<p>
<i>Eat at least 2 3/4 lbs of mixed salad and vegetables per day, consisting of "Green-Green” and “Green” foods. Of these, at least 3/4 lb should be mixed salad. Also include at least 5 cups of “Green-Green” leafy vegetables or 2 1/2 cups of other vegetables per week.</i> ~<a href="../../../about.html">Paleo in a Nutshell</a> p.102

        <i>Since we are recommending that you consume an abundance of conforming non-starchy,  colored  plant foods, what plant foods are  "conforming"? They are foods that are low-glycemic, rich in micronutrients and fiber, and harmless with regard  to  anti-nutrients  and  antigens.  Broadly,  they  include  most  salad  foods, such  as  lettuce,  onions,  cucumber,  radish,  and  mushrooms,  and  they  also include  colored  vegetables,  such  as  broccoli,  green  beans,  bell  peppers  (sweet peppers),  and  Brussels  sprouts.</i>

        <i>modern species of intensively cultivated plants tend to have lower protein content, but there are exceptions: Brussels sprouts contain 24% protein per 100 grams dry-weight.</i>

        <i>Can humans get enough protein from plant foods alone? We need less protein than we think— about 75 grams per day for an average 165-pound adult. That equates to about 2 pounds (1 kg) of Brussels sprouts per day. Not impossible!</i>
