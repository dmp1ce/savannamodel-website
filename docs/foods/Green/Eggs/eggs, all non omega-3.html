        <i>The manufacturer, Quorn, makes it available either in its raw state as a kind of ground meat look-alike or made up into veggie burgers, frankfurters, and soon. Mycoprotein is by far the best meat substitute when compared to soy protein or wheat gluten protein (seitan). Mycoprotein has a medium protein content, on a par with eggs (about 12 g protein per 100 g).</i>

        <i>Our Pleistocene forebears consumed all kinds of eggs: Ostrich, bustard, duck, and anything else they could find. Hen's eggs come close, with a proviso— seek out eggs that are rich in omega-3 oils, and it is preferable if they are also free-range and organic. Duck, turkey, quail, and goose eggs are good, too. Industrially produced eggs are a poor substitute and should not be consumed on a regular basis.</i>

        <i>Try to rid yourself of notions about which foods are to be eaten at which meals: For example, eggs are often thought of as being purely a breakfast food. In fact, you can eat them at any meal. The same goes for just about every dish: They can be eaten at any time of day.</i>

        <i>Get in the habit of thinking that a salad is often in two parts: The salad vegetables, comprised uniquely of foods from Food Group 3 (Non-starchy Vegetables), and some additions of protein-rich foods from Food Group 6 (Meat, Poultry, Eggs, and Fish). You can add tuna or chicken breast, for example, to the salad or eat as a side dish. Use a simple homemade vinaigrette of mustard, olive oil, lemon juice, and vinegar.</i>

        <i>Dinner  involves  the  same  decision-making  process  as  at lunch  time.  This  time you decide to do some cooking. Maybe 12 oz per person of stir-fried vegetables accompanied by two eggs,  any style.  Or a  grilled  trout with a  head of steamed broccoli.  It's as easy as that.</i>

        <i>Eating in fast-food restaurants is a little harder. Find a salad, if you can; discard the packet of salad dressing, unless it is simple oil and vinegar. Consider carrying a bottle of your own vinaigrette. Or eat the all-day breakfast: Eggs with tomatoes and mushrooms (without bread or roll) are acceptable, but avoid the bacon, sausage, hash browns, toast, waffles, syrup, and muffins. It is not ideal to eat the processed meat in fast-food restaurants, but if you must, order the burger (no cheese) or grilled chicken sandwich and throw away the bun.</i>

        <i>Meat, poultry, eggs, and fish (Food Group 6) can be cooked using the most appropriate method: Microwaving, steaming, grilling, baking, or sauteing. Avoid deep-frying. If using oil, just use a light coating of olive oil.</i>

        <i>in 1942, the USDA issued a new food guide that reduced the number of food groups to what they called the "Basic Seven." These were: green and yellow vegetables; oranges, tomatoes, and grapefruit; potatoes and other vegetables and fruit; milk and milk products; meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dried peas and beans; bread, flour, and cereals; and butter and fortified margarine.</i>
 ~<a href="../../../about.html">Deadly Harvest</a> p.45
    </p>
    
    <p>
        With the creation of the "basic seven", several changes were made from the 12 food groups in the family food plans. <i>"Potatoes and sweet potatoes" have been lumped in with "other vegetables and fruit." "Eggs" and "dry beans, peas, and nuts" are lumped in with "meat, poultry, and fish." The "butter" group has been expanded to "butter and fortified margarine." The word lean has been dropped from the category "lean meat." The "other fats" group and the "sugars" group have disappeared entirely.</i>

    <p>
        <i>In 1956, the "Basic Seven" groups were condensed to the "Basic Four": milk and milk products; meat, fish, poultry, eggs, dry beans, and nuts; fruits and vegetables; and grains. This time the "green and yellow vegetables" group has disappeared. "Butter and fortified margarine" has been dropped. "Oranges, tomatoes, and grapefruit" are lumped into the catch-all category "fruits and vegetables."</i>

    <p>
        <i>One USDA group, "Meat, Fish, Poultry, Dry Beans, Nuts and Eggs," seems to have been lumped together because they are, on the whole, protein-rich foods. However, not all protein-rich foods (for example, cheese) are included and some protein-poor foods (for example, chestnuts) make the list.</i>

        In the USDA meat group <i>There are significant differences among these items, so we will break down this group into three major classes. One is protein-rich foods of animal origin: "Meat, Poultry, Eggs, and Fish." The other two are protein-rich foods of plant origin: "Dry Beans and Peas (or Legumes)" and "Nuts."</i>

        <i>Protein-rich plant foods fall into two broad classes, nuts and legumes. Their protein content is comparable to that of lean beef steak—20% to 25% and sometimes more. In contrast, an egg is only around 13% protein.</i>

        <i>What are acid-forming foods? Not foods that taste acidic, but rather the ones that after digestion and metabolism have the effect of acidifying the body. They are foods that contain sulfur, phosphorus, and chlorine— found chiefly in proteins like meat, fish, eggs, and cheese. For example, bland roast chicken is one of the most acidifying foods around. Starches like bread, flour, pasta, and cereals are also acid forming.</i>

        <i>Animal matter can provide the same micronutrients as plants, such as calcium and vitamin A, but there is one essential micronutrient that has to be obtained from animal matter—vitamin B₁₂. It is only needed in tiny amounts and it is easily obtained from eggs, fish, poultry, and meat. However, without it, we sicken and die, unlike the vegan gorilla who can manage without it.</i>

        <i>Avoid protein/starch combinations— Group 6 foods (Meat, Poultry, Eggs, and Fish) with Group 2 foods (Grains) and/or Group 3 foods (Vegetables, Starchy).</i>

        <i>Contrary to the prevalent myth, consuming high-cholesterol foods like eggs has little effect on cholesterol levels, if the diet conforms to the Savanna Model. As Paleolithic expert Boyd Eaton observes, the San Bushmen consumed just as much cholesterol as the average American, yet they maintained very low levels of cholesterol in the blood.</i>
