    <p>
        <i>Our Pleistocene forebears consumed all kinds of eggs: Ostrich, bustard, duck, and anything else they could find. Hen's eggs come close, with a proviso— seek out eggs that are rich in omega-3 oils, and it is preferable if they are also free-range and organic. Duck, turkey, quail, and goose eggs are good, too. Industrially produced eggs are a poor substitute and should not be consumed on a regular basis.</i>

    <p>
        <i>Chickens would normally lay only about 170 eggs per year. With clever feeding, suitable lighting, and other stimulation, they now average 240 eggs per year. The ambition is to increase this to 700 eggs per year by the addition of sex hormones to speed up the chicken's egg-production cycle. They are fed dyes to make their yolks bright yellow, they are dusted with insecticides against parasites, and fed antibiotics to stop them from getting sick in the crowded conditions.</i>

        <i>The first farmers had to go looking for wild eggs. The Fertile Crescent is outside the tropics (it is about the same latitude as Washington, D.C.) and mostly eggs only came along in spring. It was not until chickens were domesticated that eggs were "farmed": wherever the chicken arrived, the hen's egg arrived too.</i>

        <i>In due course, as duck, goose, and turkey were domesticated, these creatures were bred for their eggs as well. Today, with the enormous advantage of price and the massive volume of battery-hen production, it is the hen's egg that totally dominates the food supply.</i>
