<p>
    <i>In nature, fats and oils do not occur on their own: They are always part of something else. The Bushman could not eat the mongongo oil without eating the nut; he could not eat the animal fat without eating the animal. Fats and oils in their separated state are in a very concentrated form and therefore more potent. That is why they should always be treated with caution.</i>

    <i>The general injunction is to consume oils sparingly. We should focus on omega-3 oils.</i>

</p>

<p>
    <i>omega-3 oils should only be used cold—in a salad dressing, for example. Omega-3 oils do not resist heat very well and the oil oxidizes and becomes toxic. If you need to heat the oil for cooking, then a monounsaturated (and thus inert) oil is best.</i>
 ~<a href="../../../../about.html">Paleo in a Nutshell</a> p.74
</p>

<p>
    <i>The trouble in the modern diet is that omega-6 vegetable oils are in everything and thus overwhelm our omega-3 consumption. We must therefore avoid any unnecessary intake. For this reason, you should strictly avoid knowingly consuming omega-6 oils</i>

    <i>In all cases, fats and oils should be consumed with restraint.</i>

</p>

<p>
    <i>Be frugal with fats and oils, even the "Green" classes. Never cook at high temperatures. Only bake or sauté at low temperatures— less than 320°F (160°C), although this may be a little higher for baking. Only use olive oil or canola (rapeseed) oil. Hot or cold, replace "Red" classes of fats and oils with "Green" classes such as olive oil, canola (rapeseed, colza) oil, hempseed oil, and flax oils ...</i>

    <i>Examples of one serving include 1 teaspoon margarine; 1 tablespoon mayonnaise or spread; 1 teaspoon canola, vegetable, olive, fish, coconut, etc. oil.</i>

    <i>Eat no more than 10% of calories as fat/oil. Focus on consumption of bioavailable omega-3 fatty acids, reduce consumption of bioavailable omega-6 fatty acids, and avoid foods with bioavailable "bad" fatty acids.</i>

<p>
    <i>Consume fats and oils generally sparingly. In addition, eliminate saturated fats in non-conforming foods, drastically curtail omega-6 oils, and boost consumption of omega-3 oils.</i>
