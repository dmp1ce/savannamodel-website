    <i>In nature, fats and oils do not occur on their own: They are always part of something else. The Bushman could not eat the mongongo oil without eating the nut; he could not eat the animal fat without eating the animal. Fats and oils in their separated state are in a very concentrated form and therefore more potent. That is why they should always be treated with caution.</i>

    <i>The general injunction is to consume oils sparingly. We should focus on omega-3 oils.</i>

    <i>omega-3 oils should only be used cold—in a salad dressing, for example. Omega-3 oils do not resist heat very well and the oil oxidizes and becomes toxic. If you need to heat the oil for cooking, then a monounsaturated (and thus inert) oil is best.</i>

<p>
    <i>The trouble in the modern diet is that omega-6 vegetable oils are in everything and thus overwhelm our omega-3 consumption. We must therefore avoid any unnecessary intake. For this reason, you should strictly avoid knowingly consuming omega-6 oils</i>

    <i>Be frugal with fats and oils, even the "Green" classes. Never cook at high temperatures. Only bake or sauté at low temperatures— less than 320°F (160°C), although this may be a little higher for baking. Only use olive oil or canola (rapeseed) oil. Hot or cold, replace "Red" classes of fats and oils with "Green" classes such as olive oil, canola (rapeseed, colza) oil, hempseed oil, and flax oils ...</i>

        <i>Monounsaturated fats were quite common in our ancestral environment, particularly in the marrow of bones and many nuts. Our bodies know how to handle them in a healthy way. Health benefits of monounsaturated fats include lowering cholesterol levels, reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke, and enhancing cell building and the immune system. Today, our most common source is olive oil. Avocado is another good source.</i>

        <i>All these omega-3 oils should only be used cold—in a salad dressing, for example. Omega-3 oils do not resist heat very well and the oil oxidizes and becomes toxic. If you need to heat the oil for cooking, then a monounsaturated (and thus inert) oil is best. Canola oil can fit the bill since its omega-3 content will withstand modest temperatures up to 340°F. We advise that cooking should never exceed this temperature anyway, but if it does, then olive oil is safest to use.</i>

        <i>A suitable choice for lunch is a mixed salad, and an appropriate quantity might be 12 oz. Weigh foods until you are used to estimating the quantities by eye— it's larger than you are used to. Get in the habit of thinking that a salad is often in two parts: The salad vegetables, comprised uniquely of foods from Food Group 3 (Non-starchy Vegetables), and some additions of protein-rich foods from Food Group 6 (Meat, Poultry, Eggs, and Fish). You can add tuna or chicken breast, for example, to the salad or eat as a side dish. Use a simple homemade vinaigrette of mustard, olive oil, lemon juice, and vinegar.</i>

        <i>Meat, poultry, eggs, and fish (Food Group 6) can be cooked using the most appropriate method: Microwaving, steaming, grilling, baking, or sauteing. Avoid deep-frying. If using oil, just use a light coating of olive oil.</i>

        <i>With regard to animal matter, many methods of conservation are acceptable. Canned oily fish (such as sardines) are, in nutritional terms, just as good as fresh. Just choose the versions that are preserved in olive oil, canola oil, or unsalted water. Smoked salmon or kipper are good, although watch out for high salt content.</i>

        <i>As with the Bushman, fat was much sought after: fatty parts of the carcass were prized, distributed with ceremony, and eaten with relish. The witchety grub was rich in monounsaturated fat, similar to olive oil.</i>

        <i>in the southern parts of Europe and in the Near East, early farmers had domesticated the olive. The earliest recorded occurrence is from the Greek island of Crete around 3500 B.C.29 Its cultivation was important to the ancient Greeks and Romans and they spread it to all the countries bordering the Mediterranean. Fresh olives are extremely bitter and must be treated with lye (a strong alkali leached from wood ash) before they can be eaten. Today, olives are grown primarily for olive oil. The Greeks first extracted the oil simply by heaping the olives on the ground in the sunshine and collecting the oil as it dribbled out of the ripe fruit. Now it is pressed out, but in the first pressing not a lot of pressure is used so that the bitterness stays behind; this is known as "extra virgin oil." Greece remains the biggest consumer at about 42 pounds per person per year, while the tiny consumption in the U.S. has risen from 10 ounces to 1.5 pounds per person annually. Similar figures are seen in England, France, and Germany.</i>

        <i>Professor Serge Renaud dug deeper and found that there were strong regional differences. In Toulouse, in the southwest of France, a Mediterranean-type diet was practised. While not consuming much olive oil, the Toulousains did use duck and goose fat rather than butter. He found that they drank red wine copiously— up to one bottle per person per day (it is the Bordeaux region after all). In contrast, in the northern city of Strasbourg, on the border with Germany, the diet is more "Anglo-Saxon": the population drank much more milk, used butter for everything, and drank beer rather than wine.</i>

        <i>fat by itself does not increase insulin levels. Therefore, fat eaten in the absence of either carbohydrates or protein is not easily absorbed into the fat cells. This explains how the Cretans could consume a jigger of olive oil on an empty stomach and not get fat.</i>

        <i>There are dozens of fatty acids, most of which are either neutral or harmful to health. Saturated myristic acid and palmitic acid are aggressive to arteries. They are particularly found in butter, cream, cheese, beef, pork, and lamb. Palmitic acid is also the chief component of palm oil, which is used in processed foods. However, the body converts another saturated fat, stearic acid (particularly found in cocoa butter), into oleic acid (as found in olive oil). Oleic acid, which dominates the family of monounsaturated fats, is neutral on the body. Olive oil is "good" because it does no harm.</i>
