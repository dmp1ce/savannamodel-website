        <i>foragers routinely roasted foods in the embers of the fire. This would include tubers, nuts, and various parts of the animal carcass. Some authorities believe that cooking (roasting) of some foods was a necessary condition for Homo sapiens to evolve. At any rate, there is no basis for the belief that humans should be eating a totally raw food diet.</i>

Today, our most common source is olive oil. Avocado is another good source.</i>
