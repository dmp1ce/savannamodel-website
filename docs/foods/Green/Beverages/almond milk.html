        <i>Do not forget that tea, herbal teas, and coffee are valid thirst quenchers. Cocoa is fine too, but make it with 100 percent cocoa powder (not chocolate mix) combined with water or almond milk. If you like, use a "Green" sweetener or honey.</i>

        <i>Milk is simply not human food and is harmful to our biochemistry. The milk of almonds (and other nuts) is a great alternative to regular milk, particularly in cookery. However, soy milk must be avoided. Fruit juices, even when freshly made, are glycemic— for this reason, they get the "Amber" classification. It is much better to eat the fruit itself. Watch out for tomato juice: Choose brands that are made from pure tomatoes and have no salt. Sugar-sweetened carbonated drinks and colas are high-glycemic and disrupt bone building.</i>
