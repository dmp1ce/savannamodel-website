If you know your hosts well, it is all right to call in advance and mention that you have special dietary requirements. Say that you prefer fish over red meat or that you don't like to eat fruit after a meal. Mention that you like green salads and lots of green vegetables. Then, dig into your meal and enjoy it for what it is.

        <i>If you are eating according to th e Savanna Model, what is the likelihood that you are suffering any deficiencies? The answer is, highly unlikely. You will be consuming eight times the weight of non-starchy plant food compared to the average Am erican. So, even on plant foods with "reduced levels" of micronutrients in th e soil in w hich they're grow n, your intake will be w ell into the healthy intake comfort zone. The one nutrient that is hard to get this way is omega-3 essential fa tty acids. In this regard, we strongly recommend eating at least one portion of oily fish per day instead of popping an omega-3 supplement.</i>

        <i>Traditionally, the Japanese are Buddhists and, as such, they did not eat animals at all. However, they did eat fish, often raw. By Western standards, it was a high consumption, around 90 g (3.15 oz) per person per day (four times as much as the average American). From this, they got a high consumption of omega-3 fish oil, notably the essential fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA).</i>

        <i>At home, by a fluke of culture, geography, and luck, the Japanese have hit on a good lifestyle, but even so, it is not perfect. For example, they smoke too much and they consume too much salt. More than in most other countries, the Japanese die of strokes and heart disease. The diet of raw fish means that they absorb the live eggs and larvae of intestinal parasites, so that worm infestations of the gut, virtually unknown in the West, are quite common in Japan.</i>

        <i>A study carried out in the remote and tiny Okinawan island of Kohama found that the inhabitants eat even more fish, 144 g (about 5 oz), and far less salt, about 6 g per day, than their mainland neighbors. They eat seaweed and herbaceous plants and also sweet potato and tofu (soybean curd). They have adopted some Chinese practices from nearby Taiwan, eating some pork and drinking green tea. And they exercise a lot: 95 percent of the eighty-year-olds studied led active lives, working long hours every day in their fish-farming paddies.</i>

Unlike the Okinawans, they ate bread— a rough-ground, whole-wheat variety— and they had a moderate fat consumption through the sparing use of olive oil in the kitchen. They also had an extraordinary custom: For the Cretan, traditional breakfast often consisted of a small amount of olive oil downed in one gulp, and that was it until lunch time. Wine was also commonly drunk, but in moderation.</i>

They shared the land with a wide variety of creatures: giraffe, lion, elephant, warthog, rhinoceros, hyena, antelope, gazelle, zebra, baboons, chimpanzees, vultures, eagles, flamingos, and many more. In addition, there were snakes, porcupines, crocodiles, lizards, tortoises, snails, grasshoppers, and a myriad of small mammals, reptiles, and insects. The lakes, streams, and waterholes teemed with many species of freshwater fish, shellfish, frogs, toads, ducks, geese, and other aquatic creatures.</i>

        <i>With the Industrial Revolution going full-swing during the 19th century, cities grew to sizes never before seen in history. Chicago's population increased 17-fold from 30,000 in 1850 to 500,000 in 1870. New York City grew 25 times bigger, from 60,000 in 1800 to 1.5 million in 1870. In contrast, Babylon at the time of the Biblical exodus (1447 B .C .) was only about 60,000 total. Feeding populations in these enormous agglomerations required novel methods. It was quite impossible to get most fresh foods to them in the normal way. Food had to be "preserved,"— that is, processed in a way that stopped it from going bad. Meat and fish were a particular problem but there were tried-and-true methods to con­ serve it: salting and smoking. Salt beef, bacon, cured ham, kippered herring, and bologna were just a few examples that took over the diet of city dwellers, replacing their fresh equivalent.</i>

In the 1870s, the Japanese reported that they could cure beriberi by feeding their sailors with some extra rations of vegetables and fish. We now know that beriberi is a disease caused by a deficiency of vitamin B₁ (thiamine).</i>

        <i>in 1942, the USDA issued a new food guide that reduced the number of food groups to what they called the "Basic Seven."

        With the creation of the "basic seven", several changes were made from the 12 food groups in the family food plans. <i>"Potatoes and sweet potatoes" have been lumped in with "other vegetables and fruit." "Eggs" and "dry beans, peas, and nuts" are lumped in with "meat, poultry, and fish." The "butter" group has been expanded to "butter and fortified margarine."

        <i>One USDA group, "Meat, Fish, Poultry, Dry Beans, Nuts and Eggs," seems to have been lumped together because they are, on the whole, protein-rich foods.

        <i>At the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), meat is the term applied to the flesh of domesticated mammals, such as cattle, pig, and sheep. More conventionally, this is known as "red meat," which is the designation used here. Similarly, "game" refers to the flesh of any wild land animal, such as wild boar or pheasant. "White meat" refers to flesh taken from domesticated birds, such as chickens, and "seafood" refers to fish and shellfish. We will look at both wild and domesticated sources of animal products. The USDA does not include certain classes of animal foods that were common in our ancestors' diet— the "exotic" categories of reptiles, worms, insects, and gastropods (snails and slugs).</i>

        <i>Our ancient ancestors certainly consumed fish and shellfish on a modest scale— up to 12% of calories according to Michael Crawford, professor of nutrition at London Metropolitan University. As we saw in Chapter 1, fish were speared and trapped as the occasion presented itself. Pleistocene man (or more likely women) easily collected shellfish along the shoreline of African lakes and rivers.</i>

        <i>Early civilizations took a long time to learn to farm fish. Carp originated in China and have been raised in ponds and rice paddies there for 3,000 years. From about 500 B.C., the ancient Egyptians raised fish in specially built ponds. The main species was Nile perch, a variety of tilapia, which is still commonly available today. Carp cultivation has spread all over the world, notably central Europe, but it was always on the scale of the village pond or its equivalent.</i>

        <i>It was not until the 1960s that fish farming or "aquaculture" came of age. Since then, salmon, trout, catfish, and tilapia have been farmed on an industrial scale. They have almost completely displaced their wild counterparts from our tables. Less commonly farmed are carp, mullet, redfish, and sea bass. Efforts are already under way to farm tuna, cod, sea bream, and turbot in vast enclosed offshore pens.</i>

        <i>The fish and shellfish consumed in our ancestral diet were entirely of freshwater varieties. On the other hand, modern fish farming is concentrated mostly on seafood.

Drive these out of your diet and favor the omega-3 oils at every opportunity. But don't go too far.

But they get away with smoking because their diet, while not perfect, is a lot better than the one that is common in the West. In other words, the Japanese diet, turns out to be closer to the ideal diet for the human species than what is eaten elsewhere.
