    <p>
        <i>Don't be put off by some of the bizarre foods. We are not saying you will have to start eating locusts, turtles, and frogs! (Although many societies from Africa to Asia do.) No— what we are saying is that we need to find everyday foods which have the same specification in our own supermarkets. And the good news it is perfectly possible— even easy.</i>

        Creatures such <i>as alligator, ostrich, emu, kangaroo, frogs' legs, and escargots (snails). All correspond very well to the kind of animal matter that our Pleistocene ancestors ate all the time. Other exotic foods are making their appearance, particularly bush tucker from Australia, which corresponds to the food traditionally eaten by the Australian Aboriginal.</i>

        <i>Our ancestors were not alone in the savanna. They shared the land with a wide variety of creatures: giraffe, lion, elephant, warthog, rhinoceros, hyena, antelope, gazelle, zebra, baboons, chimpanzees, vultures, eagles, flamingos, and many more. In addition, there were snakes, porcupines, crocodiles, lizards, tortoises, snails, grasshoppers, and a myriad of small mammals, reptiles, and insects. The lakes, streams, and waterholes teemed with many species of freshwater fish, shellfish, frogs, toads, ducks, geese, and other aquatic creatures.</i>

        <i>Reptile foods, including crocodile, alligator, and turtle, although uncommon in the Western diet, are still readily available to the enthusiast. In addition, many societies make use of snakes, such as python and boa constrictor, and the French have made a delicacy of frog's legs. All of these foods, as they are currently available, readily fit the Savanna Model.</i> ~<a href="../../../about.html">Deadly Harvest</a> p.63
