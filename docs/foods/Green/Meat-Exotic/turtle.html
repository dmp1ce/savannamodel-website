        <i>Don't be put off by some of the bizarre foods. We are not saying you will have to start eating locusts, turtles, and frogs! (Although many societies from Africa to Asia do.) No— what we are saying is that we need to find everyday foods which have the same specification in our own supermarkets. And the good news it is perfectly possible— even easy.</i>

        <i>Our ancestors were not alone in the savanna. They shared the land with a wide variety of creatures: giraffe, lion, elephant, warthog, rhinoceros, hyena, antelope, gazelle, zebra, baboons, chimpanzees, vultures, eagles, flamingos, and many more. In addition, there were snakes, porcupines, crocodiles, lizards, tortoises, snails, grasshoppers, and a myriad of small mammals, reptiles, and insects. The lakes, streams, and waterholes teemed with many species of freshwater fish, shellfish, frogs, toads, ducks, geese, and other aquatic creatures.</i>

        For Aborigines, <i>The animal food collected would be eggs, turtles, snakes, shellfish, crabs, caterpillars (e.g., the witchety grub and the bogong moth), land snails, and the goanna (a giant lizard). Sweet foods were very rare but much prized. Disproportionate amounts of time were spent on finding a bees' nest to smoke out. Other sweetmeats were the honey ant, gorged with nectar, and "lerp," a sweet insect secretion on eucalyptus leaves. In times of scarcity, grass seeds were collected, winnowed, and ground between two handheld stones. The drudgery of this task was viewed with such distaste that it was only done very rarely.</i>

        <i>30,000 years ago, the Cro-Magnons of Europe ate fish, turtles, shellfish, and birds. Meanwhile the Neanderthals, who lived alongside them, ate reindeer, mammoth, and other large herbivores.</i>

        <i>We must also mention eggs from reptiles: eggs from crocodiles and turtles would have been quite common in the diet of our African Pleistocene ancestors. Turtles lay eggs in prodigious numbers in sandy shorelines, and collecting and commercializing them has become a major industry in Malaysia. Wild eggs in general form a tiny part of consumption in the developed world and, with the possible exception of quail eggs, most people have never even seen one.</i>

        <i>Reptile foods, including crocodile, alligator, and turtle, although uncommon in the Western diet, are still readily available to the enthusiast. In addition, many societies make use of snakes, such as python and boa constrictor, and the French have made a delicacy of frog's legs. All of these foods, as they are currently available, readily fit the Savanna Model.</i> ~<a href="../../../about.html">Deadly Harvest</a> p.63
