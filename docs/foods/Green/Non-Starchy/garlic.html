        <i>Not everyone realizes that garlic salt is plain salt with garlic flavoring; regular stock cubes are over 50 percent salt; soy sauce is just liquid salt fermented with soybeans.</i>

        <i>Try this quick (five-minute) method of cooking vegetables. Put a quarter-inch of water into a saucepan with a sliced clove of garlic and a bay leaf (or a pinch of oregano). Add a tablespoon of canola oil. The boiling water forms an emulsion with the oil. Add vegetables (fresh or frozen). Heat moderately with the cover on, but stir frequently, too. The vegetables cook fast, partly by boiling and partly by steaming. At the end, when the vegetables are close to done, heat vigorously and stir continuously until all the water has gone. They will be a beautiful golden brown when the water has evaporated. Always use plenty of herbs. As many vegetables soak up oil, this method greatly reduces the quantity of oil absorbed.</i>

        <i>Not all underground vegetables are starchy. For example, turnip and radish, which both originated in Asia, are non-starchy, as are bulbs such as onion and garlic from Asia and the leek from the Middle East. Corms such as Chinese water chestnut are also non-starchy. Unlike the starchy roots, they mostly get their bulk from another com pound called "inulin."</i>

        <i>Many primitive societies eat snails and their shell-less cousins, the slug. The idea to some minds seems grotesque, yet they are a valuable, easily collected source of food. In fact snails have been commonly raised and eaten in the Middle East and Europe for thousands of years. The French, of course, have made a national dish out of snails: "escargots" cooked in garlic and butter are even considered a delicacy. Snail and slug flesh conforms to the Savanna Model, although the French recipe is not ideal nutritionally.</i>
