    <h2>Additional Quotes</h2>
    <p>Specific references to <b>Moose</b> throughout Geoff Bond's publications.</p>
    
    <p>
        <i>In most instances, meat from various wild creatures has a conforming fatty acid profile. Truly wild game that feeds off what it finds in its natural habitat is an approved animal matter and is fine to consume in moderation. It will be low-fat and should have a good fatty acid profile. This includes wild boar, moose, caribou, and bison.</i>
 ~<a href="../../../about.html">Paleo in a Nutshell</a> p.69
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <i>The amount of wild meat that the average person in the developed world consumes in a year is close to zero. However, both in North America and in parts of Europe, the hunting of wild animals is still possible on a controlled, recreational basis. In this way, the meat of bear, moose, caribou, deer, wild boar, elk, and similar creatures enters the diets of some hunters' families and the diners at specialist restaurants. This meat corresponds quite closely to the hunted big game of the Savanna Model. The same applies to small game such as the squirrel, hare, and rabbit.</i>
