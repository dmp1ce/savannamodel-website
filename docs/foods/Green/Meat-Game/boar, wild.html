        <i>In most instances, meat from various wild creatures has a conforming fatty acid profile. Truly wild game that feeds off what it finds in its natural habitat is an approved animal matter and is fine to consume in moderation. It will be low-fat and should have a good fatty acid profile. This includes wild boar, moose, caribou, and bison.</i>

        <i>These early farmers, about 8000 B.C., found three creatures that lent themselves to taming and breeding in captivity: the "mouflon," the "pasang," and the wild boar. In 6000 B.C., this same ingenious people domesticated the massive aurochs, an ox-like creature that stood six feet high at the shoulder. All four species of animal had body compositions very similar to the wild game eaten by our ancestors of the Savanna Model.</i>

        <i>"game" refers to the flesh of any wild land animal, such as wild boar or pheasant.</i>

        <i>Ever inventive, these New Stone Age farmers bred these animals to improve their value and usefulness. However, in doing so over the past 10,000 years they, and all farmers since, changed the breed. The mouflon has been transformed into the sheep, the wild boar's descendant is the pig, the aurochs became the smaller cow, and the pasang became today's goat. As we shall see, with the exception of the goat, the changes were not beneficial.</i>

        <i>The amount of wild meat that the average person in the developed world consumes in a year is close to zero. However, both in North America and in parts of Europe, the hunting of wild animals is still possible on a controlled, recreational basis. In this way, the meat of bear, moose, caribou, deer, wild boar, elk, and similar creatures enters the diets of some hunters' families and the diners at specialist restaurants. This meat corresponds quite closely to the hunted big game of the Savanna Model. The same applies to small game such as the squirrel, hare, and rabbit.</i>

        <i>Pigs (and the wild boar from which they are descended) are creatures that browse freely in woodlands, even digging up earthworms and truffles. Today, pigs are fed on anything from restaurant scraps to time-expired processed foods. Sheep actually prefer eating the type of plant called "forb," which is any kind of herbaceous plant except grass. Today, perversely, sheep are fed only on grass (if they are lucky) or otherwise on artificial concentrated feed made from rejected grains, vegetable oils, and soybean waste. Japanese researchers have demonstrated that sheep, cattle, and pigs have a "good" fatty acid profile if they feed in their natural habitat, whereas they have a harmful fatty acid profile when fed conventionally.</i>
