    <i>Certain saturated fats derived from plants, like coconut oil and cocoa butter, have become a fetish consumption by some health mavens. Actually, none of these fats was common in our savanna environment but, by a quirk of triglyceride biochemistry, their palmitic and myristic acids (the harmful fatty acids found in saturated fats) are not readily bioavailable. This means they are not readily taken in by the body. As a result, they do not have the devastating effect on our biochemistry that those fats of animal origin do.</i>

        <i>That is to say, the position of these fatty acids on the glycerol molecule is an important factor. In this way, for examÂ­ple, cocoa butter and coconut oil and butter have a more favorable category than a simple examination of their saturated fat content would have predicted. In all cases, fats and oils should be consumed with restraint</i>
